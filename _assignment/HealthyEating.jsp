	<h2 class="head2">Healthy Eating Tips</h2>
	<p  class="para">As you grow older, you go through many changes, and you may need to adjust your lifestyle for healthy aging. Healthy eating and regular physical activity can be keys to good health at any age. Making suitable lifestyle choices may also prevent some health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. Health tips include</p>
	<ul class="ulist">
	<li class="list">Select high-fiber foods like whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, unsalted nuts and seeds, deeply colored vegetables (like green beans), and fruits</li>
	<li class="list">Avoid fried foods. Choose broiled, grilled, or boiled options instead.</li>
	<li class="list">Drink vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk; milk products; or nondairy soy, almond, rice, or other drinks with added vitamin D and calcium to help keep your bones strong as you age.</li>
	<li class="list">Drink fluids throughout the day. You may feel less thirsty as you get older, but your body needs fluids to stay healthy and keep you regular. If you have a bladder control problem, check with your doctor about what, how much, and when to drink liquids.</li>
	<li class="list">Ask your health care professional about whether or how you can safely become active or increase your physical activity.</li>

	<h2 class="head2">Healthy Eating</h2>
	<h3 class="head3">What kinds of foods and drinks do I need to consume as I age?</h3>
	<p class="para">As you get older, your body begins to need fewer calories, but you need just as many nutrients. So, you will want to focus on eating nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient-dense foods pack a lot of vitamins NIH external link, minerals NIH external link, and other nutrients your body needs into a smaller number of calories.</p>
	<p class='para'>Consume more nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Older adults should "consume foods from the rainbow" because they are rich in nutrients, including</p>
	<ul class="ulist">
	<li class='list'>fruits and vegetables</li>
	<li class='list'>whole grains, like oatmeal, whole-grain bread, and brown rice</li>
	<li class='list'>fat-free or low-fat milk; milk products; or nondairy soy, almond, rice, or other drinks with added vitamin D and calcium</li>
	<li class='list'>seafood, lean meats, poultry, and eggs</li>
	<li class='list'>beans, peas, unsalted nuts, and seeds, if you tolerate them and aren’t allergic</li>
	</ul>
	<p class='para'>Consume less of these foods and drinks. Some foods and drinks have many calories but few of the essential nutrients your body needs. Added sugars, solid fats, and salt—such as those in packaged foods—pack a lot of calories but don’t provide a healthy amount of nutrients. Limit foods and drinks such as</p>
	<ul class="ulist">
	<li class='list'>sugar-sweetened drinks and foods</li>
	<li class='list'>foods made with solid fats—butter, lard, margarine, and shortening</li>
	<li class='list'>foods high in added fat (such as butter or lard) and salt (sodium)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class='head2'>How can I follow a healthy eating plan?</h2>
	<p class='para'>How much food and drinks you should consume each day depends on your weight, sex, age, metabolism, and how active you are. In general, men need more calories than women. Younger adults need more calories than adults in midlife and older. At all ages, adults who are more physically active may need to consume more calories than those who are less active.</p>
	<p class='para'>Control portion sizes. A portion is the amount of food or drink you consume in one sitting. Being aware of food portions, serving sizes, and how often you consume them can help you make healthier food and drink choices.</p>
	<p class='para'>Many people eat more than they need, especially when eating out or getting takeout. Try these tips.</p>
	<ul class='ulist'>
	<li class='list'>Remember, restaurants often serve more than one portion. If the portion is bigger than one serving, take home or put away the rest to eat later.</li>

	<li class='list'>Avoid watching TV, your smartphone, or other devices while eating. You may not notice how much you are consuming if you’re distracted.</li>

You can use these facts to make healthy food choices.</p>

	<h2 class='head2'>Keeping Track of Your Eating Habits</h2>
	<p class='para'>Many factors may affect your ability to eat well and enjoy your meals and snacks, including dental problems, being on a fixed income, and limited ability to move around.</p>
	<p class='para'>If you don’t have pain in your fingers or hands when writing, try to keep a food diary. Write down all the foods and drinks you have in a day and any concerns you have. Instead of a written diary, consider trying one of the many apps now available on mobile phones, tablets, and other devices. These apps have become a popular way to track and improve health habits, including what and how much you eat and drink, sleep, and weigh. When you visit your health care provider, bring your written or digital food diary and review it together to see if you are getting the nutrients you need.</p>
	<p class='para'>Your health care professional may recommend that you have different foods and beverages or that you change the number of calories you get each day. He or she may also refer you to a registered dietitian for help with choosing an eating plan that’s right for you.</p>
