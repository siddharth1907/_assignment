		<h2 class='head2'>Works Older Adults Can Do</h2>
		<img src='images/img18.jpg' class='imgs'>
		<p class='para'>Believe it or not, plenty of jobs for older people are available. And yes, you can work after retirement—for all kinds of good reasons. For example, maybe you want to earn extra money, help others, meet new people, or explore a career you've always dreamed about but never had the chance to really try out before. Or maybe you've heard that, as you grow older, having a job can provide a surprising number of benefits for your physical and mental health.</p>
		<p class='para'>The fact is, many of today's seniors are redefining what it means to be retired—by continuing to work. They're discovering that their options for making money are as diverse as their many possible reasons for being part of the workforce. And, of course, there's much more to choose from than just full-time employment. For instance, some seniors start businesses after retirement. Others find part-time jobs.</p>
		<p class='para'>For seniors over 65, this fact often remains a strong motivating factor: Working past your retirement age can make a big difference when it comes to funding your future elderly years.</p>
		<p class='para'>Seniors can get many kinds of jobs. Aside, perhaps, from some extremely physically demanding occupations, almost any job that can be done by a younger person can be done by someone older. It really just depends on the individual, since everyone ages differently.</p>
