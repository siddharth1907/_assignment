	<h2 class='head2'>Physical Activity</h2>
	<p class='para'>Physical activity is good for your health at every age. If you have never been active, starting regular physical activity now may improve your strength, balance, flexibility, and endurance—being able to move for periods of time without stopping.</p>
	<p class='para'>Being physically active may help you maintain a healthy weight and avoid chronic health problems as you mature. It may help you reduce symptoms of arthritis , anxiety , and  depression . It may help keep diabetes and high blood pressure under control. Being active may also help you live on your own longer by keeping you healthy.</p>
	<img src='images/img2.jpg' class='imgs'>
	<p class='para'>Being active can be hard if you aren’t able to move around well, use a cane or walker, or have serious health problems. But you can find some activities to help you move more. For example, slowly raising your arms or legs on a regular basis may help you feel more flexible.</p>
	<h2 class='head2'>How much and what type of physical activity do I need?</h2>
	<p class='para'>Keep in mind that some physical activity is better than none. Aim to keep moving as often as you can.</p>
	<p class='para'>Healthy older adults should regularly do five types of activities</p>
	<ul class='ulist'>
	<li class='list'>aerobic (also called endurance or cardio) activities</li>
	<li class='list'>activities to strengthen muscles</li>
	<li class='list'>activities to improve balance</li>
	<li class='list'>activities to increase flexibility</li>
	<li class='list'>activities that combine more than one type of physical activity, such as aerobic, muscle strengthening, and balance training (called “multicomponent” activities)</li>
	</ul>
	<p class='para'>If you have a serious health problem like diabetes or heart disease, stay aware of how it might limit how much activity you can do safely.</p>
	<p class='para'>You can divide your activity throughout the day or week—whatever works best for you. Studies show that spreading activity across at least 3 days a week can improve your health, lower your chances of getting hurt, and keep you from feeling tired.</p>
	<p class='para'>Many activities give you more than just one benefit! Water aerobics with weights give you both aerobic and strengthening benefits. Yoga combines aerobics, balance, flexibility, and strengthening. Choose activities you enjoy.</p>
	<p class='para'>If you have trouble getting started or staying physically active, see some tips  to help you overcome roadblocks to becoming more active. To track your progress and stay aware of how you feel while you’re active, you might want to keep an activity log.</p>
