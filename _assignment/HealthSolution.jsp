	<h3 class='head3'>Why is keeping a healthy weight important?</h3>
	<p class='para'>Your body changes as you age. For example, if you are less active, your muscles may not work as well, and that can affect your strength. You may also use fewer calories, especially if you don’t get any physical activity. Over time, if you eat and drink more calories from food or beverages than your body uses from physical activity and daily living, your body may store the extra calories leading to weight gain. Extra weight may lead to overweight or obesity.</p>
	<p class='para'>Overweight and obesity may increase your risk for</p>

	<h3 class='head3'>What is a healthy weight for me?</h3>
	<h4 class='head4'>Two measures can help you determine whether you are at a healthy weight.</h4>
	<ul class='ulist'>
	<li class='list'>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure based on your weight in relation to your height. You can use an online tool to calculate your BMI <br>Experts recommend that older adults have a BMI between 25 and 27—slightly higher than the recommended range of 18.5 to 24.9 for younger adults. On the other hand, some people, particularly older adults, can have a BMI in the normal range, but still have too much body fat. That’s why it’s also important to also measure your waist size.</li>
	<li class='list'>Your waist size is a measure that may tell you if you carry too much body fat. Women with a waist size of more than 35 inches and men with a waist size of more than 40 inches may be more likely to develop health problems.</li>
	</ul>
	<img src='images/img10.jpeg' width='300' class='imgs'>
	<h3 class='head3'>Being underweight can also be a health concern for older adults. It could mean that you</h3>
	<ul class='ulist'>
	<li class='list'>have increased risk for weakness and bone loss</li>
	<li class='list'>are not eating enough calories to maintain your weight</li>
	<li class='list'>don’t have access to enough food or foods that meet your nutrient needs</li>
	<li class='list'>have an illness or medical condition</li>
	</ul>
	<p class='para'>Keeping a healthy weight may help improve your health. The weight that is healthiest for you may be higher than that of a younger person. Ask your health care professional what a healthy weight for you may be.</p>
	<h3 class='head3'>What are some tips to keep a healthy weight?</h3>
	<ul class='ulist'>
	<li class='list'>Exercise often: Studies prove that people with high activity levels are more likely to maintain their weight loss than others who are not as active. Set exercise goals, aiming to build up to a minimum of 200-300 minutes of exercise per week</li>
	<li class='list'>Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water or other no-calorie unsweetened beverages. Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages.</li>
	<li class='list'>Eat whole foods. Focus on a healthy eating pattern of whole, unprocessed foods that is rich in produce and fiber, contains lean protein sources, and is lower in fat.</li>
	<li class='list'>Eat responsibly and mindfully. Pay attention to portion sizes and avoid overeating. Look at the nutrition facts on food labels listed on packages, including the serving size. Using smaller plates and bowls may help you choose smaller portions at meals. Prioritize meal time. Eat slowly, with focus on your meal. Listen to your body ‘s physical cues to stop eating before you feel overly full. On special occasions, choose your foods as wisely as you would on any other day.</li>
	<li class='list'>Plan your meals ahead of time. By planning meals in advance, you can make healthier choices that are not influenced by physical hunger. Plan home-cooked meals, reserving restaurant dining for special occasions. Packing low-calorie snacks like fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains can help keep hunger controlled throughout the day.</li>
